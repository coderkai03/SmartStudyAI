## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: An app that allows you to enter key terms for various study subjects and uses an AI to write the most appropriate definition for the terms. It will allow for a more robust and adaptable studying experience, not having the limitations of focusing on one particular topic over another.
